# Quirk catalogue

Every switch in the wallet has a note here with where it was observed, when, what breaks in a dApp because of it, and its lifecycle status: `reported` (sent in, not reproduced), `confirmed` (reproduced against a current wallet version), `historical` (the wallet fixed it, kept because the spec does not rule the behaviour out). Historical quirks never run in a recommended bundle, you switch them on explicitly.

No switch without a note. A quirk nobody can trace is the stale wallet profile this project exists to avoid.

Found one we do not have? Open an issue with wallet name, version and platform, the CIP-30 method, what the spec expects, what the wallet does, and a minimal reproduction. Never include keys, mnemonics or funded addresses.
