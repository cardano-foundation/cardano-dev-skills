# Ouroboros Genesis from-origin sync (operator guide)

This guide covers configuring Dingo for **from-origin** (from-genesis) sync using
Ouroboros Genesis density selection with a biased fast-sync source — for example
a local shallow peer or the Genesis Sync Accelerator (GSA) — corroborated by
independent ledger peers.

For the internal design, see `ARCHITECTURE.md` → **Chain Selection → Ouroboros
Genesis trust model**.

## When this applies

Genesis mode is used only when **all** of these hold:

- `genesisBootstrap.enabled: true` (the default), and
- the node is starting **from origin** (no `intersectTip`, no explicit
  intersect points), i.e. an empty database syncing from slot 0.

A node bootstrapped from a Mithril snapshot, or resuming an existing database,
does not enter Genesis mode — it syncs with normal Praos chain selection.

## Trust model at a glance

| Mode | What it trusts |
|------|----------------|
| **Praos** (normal) | The longest valid chain from any peer. |
| **Mithril bootstrap** | A signed snapshot at a trust boundary, then Praos above it. |
| **Genesis** (from origin) | Header **density** within a `3k/f`-slot window, **corroborated by independent peers**. |

The security goal for from-origin sync is that a fast source which serves blocks
quickly but is not itself trustworthy (a shallow local peer, GSA) **cannot steer
the node onto a chain no independent peer shares**. Dingo enforces this with a
**corroboration gate**: the densest fast source is only followed while other
peers confirm its recent chain — every block a witness has seen within the
candidate's window must match the candidate's, so agreeing on one old ancestor
and then forking is not enough. A divergent or uncorroborated source is **denied
selection** and the node **stalls** rather than following it.

Assumptions (the security property holds only under these):

- At least `corroborationPeers` **honest, independent** peers are reachable and
  within the Genesis window of the fast source (e.g. seeded from a ledger peer
  snapshot). If the fast source races far beyond every corroborator's window,
  corroboration fails closed and the node stalls until the corroborators catch
  up — this is safe but means corroborators must not be left far behind.
- Those peers really are independent. The node can only enforce **distinct remote
  hosts** (several connections from one IP cannot self-corroborate); it cannot
  tell whether two hosts are the same operator, ASN, or chain view. Establishing
  genuine independence is the operator's responsibility (see below).

Under these assumptions a bad or divergent fast source can at worst stall the
node. A fork that diverges only in blocks no honest peer has yet observed is not
independently contradicted until a corroborator advances past it. If that fork
conflicts with the local chain, the authoritative resolver still compares the
fully fetched peer and local paths by density from their exact common
intersection. That comparison does not provide independent witness confirmation
of the unseen suffix.

## Configuration

`dingo.yaml`:

```yaml
genesisBootstrap:
  enabled: true
  # 0 auto-derives the density window from Shelley genesis params (3k/f).
  windowSlots: 0
  # Independent peers that must report the same recent blocks before a fast
  # source may drive Genesis selection. 0 disables corroboration (density-only).
  # Set this to the number of independent snapshot/ledger peers you expect to
  # corroborate the fast source.
  corroborationPeers: 2
```

Equivalent CLI flags / environment variables:

- `--genesis-bootstrap-enabled` / `DINGO_GENESIS_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED`
- `--genesis-bootstrap-window-slots` / `DINGO_GENESIS_BOOTSTRAP_WINDOW_SLOTS`
- `--genesis-bootstrap-corroboration-peers` / `DINGO_GENESIS_BOOTSTRAP_CORROBORATION_PEERS`

## Topology: fast source + corroborating snapshot

Put the fast source in `localRoots` (mark it `trustable` so peer governance
keeps it as a preferred ingress source) and point `peerSnapshotFile` at a
cardano-node ledger peer snapshot. When Genesis selection is active and the
snapshot has relays, Dingo seeds the snapshot relays as ledger peers before
outbound startup — these are the corroborators.

**Validate corroborator independence.** The gate only enforces that
corroborators are on *distinct remote hosts* from each other and from the fast
source; it cannot tell whether two hosts belong to the same operator, ASN, or
share a chain view. The security property assumes the corroborators are
genuinely independent, so populate the snapshot with large ledger peers run by
distinct operators on distinct infrastructure, and avoid pointing several
snapshot entries at relays that ultimately share an upstream. A snapshot full of
related relays satisfies the count but not the trust assumption.

`topology.json`:

```json
{
  "localRoots": [
    {
      "accessPoints": [
        { "address": "gsa.internal.example", "port": 3001 }
      ],
      "advertise": false,
      "trustable": true,
      "valency": 1
    }
  ],
  "publicRoots": [
    { "accessPoints": [], "advertise": false }
  ],
  "peerSnapshotFile": "peer-snapshot.json",
  "useLedgerAfterSlot": 185500763
}
```

The `peerSnapshotFile` path is resolved relative to the topology file. If the
snapshot yields no usable peers, startup falls back to topology `bootstrapPeers`
(so keep a bootstrap-peer list configured as a safety net).

## What you should observe

- **Log at startup**: `Genesis chain selection enabled` with `genesis_window_slots`,
  `security_param`, and `min_corroborating_peers`.
- **Uncorroborated fast source**: a throttled warning
  `genesis fast source lacks corroboration; denying chain selection` and a
  `chainselection.genesis_corroboration_failed` event carrying the source
  connection, its observed density, the corroborator count, and the required
  count. While this persists the source's **blocks are withheld from the ledger**
  (its tips are still observed so corroboration can form, but its
  `ledger.ChainsyncEvent`/blockfetch is gated off), so the node makes no forward
  progress on that source — this is expected and safe. A best-peer → none
  transition also logs `chain selection stalled: no selectable peer` and emits
  `chainselection.selected_none`. Investigate whether the snapshot peers are
  reachable and on the same chain as the fast source.
- **Exit to Praos**: once the local tip catches up to within the Genesis window
  of the best corroborated peer's *advertised* tip (the network tip — not the
  headers delivered so far), the node logs `exiting Genesis selection mode` and
  emits `chainselection.genesis_mode_exited` (local slot, best known slot,
  window). Normal Praos selection takes over from there.

`GenesisStatus()` on the chain selector exposes the live mode, window, selected
fast source, and per-peer density/corroboration for metrics or debugging.

## Tuning `corroborationPeers`

- **0** — corroboration off. The densest source wins on density alone (prior
  behavior). Use only when every configured peer is already trusted.
- **1** — a single independent peer must confirm the fast source. Minimal
  protection; a lone honest snapshot peer is enough to keep going.
- **2+** — require a quorum of distinct-host peers. More robust against a small
  set of colluding/divergent sources, but the node stalls until that many
  reachable peers agree, so size it to how many independent snapshot peers you
  actually connect. Raising this raises the required *count*, not the
  independence of the peers you supply — that is fixed by your snapshot contents
  (see "Validate corroborator independence").

## Limitations (deferred)

Dingo implements intersection-anchored density for authoritative local fork
choice, but not every optimization in the reference implementation.
Specifically **not** implemented:

- **ChainSync Jumping** and **Devoted BlockFetch** (a
  performance/robustness optimization for downloading across many peers).
- **Independent testimony beyond every witness frontier.** The corroboration
  gate confirms a witness's chain within their overlap, but cannot testify about
  a not-yet-witnessed suffix. A fast source that forks only after every honest
  witness's frontier remains corroborated until a witness advances past the
  fork. Intersection-anchored density still resolves a conflict with the local
  candidate; independent confirmation of the suffix cannot happen before a
  witness observes it.
- **Peer-governance demotion** wired to the corroboration-failure event; today
  the source is denied selection (stall) but kept connected so it can serve
  blocks once corroboration arrives.

The first and third are performance/refinement work; the second is an inherent
limit on what the configured corroborators have observed, documented here so
operators do not mistake current overlap for testimony about a future suffix.
