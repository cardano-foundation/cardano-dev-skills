# Constitution Section Index

Routing table into the mirrored constitutional text. Read this file first, identify the
sections the action engages, then read only those line ranges. Never load the whole document.

The text lives in the registered `Cardano Constitution` source, one directory per enacted
version:

```
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../docs/sources/cardano-constitution/cardano-constitution-2/cardano-constitution-2.txt.md
```

Version and currency: see `constitution-meta.md`. Upstream version directories are immutable
once enacted — an amendment arrives as a new sibling directory (`cardano-constitution-3/`),
never as an edit to this file — so the line numbers below are stable for this version. If a
newer version directory exists, stop and follow `constitution-meta.md`.

## How to read a section

Each row gives the line where a section starts; the next row bounds it. Use `Read` with
`offset` set to the start line and `limit` covering the range. If a line number does not land
on the expected heading, recover by `Grep`-ing the full title from the Title column — full
titles are unique, but bare section numbers are not (every Article has a "Section 1").

Heading format in the document: articles and appendices are bold-only lines
(`**ARTICLE II. ...**`), their sections are `### **Section N ...**`, and appendix subsections
are `### **N. ...**`.
