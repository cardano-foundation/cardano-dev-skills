// every method is safe on the zero value, so a Node built directly in a
// test needs no extra initialization.
//
// A live database Restore or Truncate replaces n.ledgerState; this struct
// deliberately does not, so the probe never has to chase a pointer another
// goroutine is swapping. The rebuilt ledger reports into the same struct
// because ledgerStateConfig closes over n, not over the ledger.
// Every field is guarded by mu: recordTipGap's generation check and its
// store have to be one critical section, or a tick a superseded ledger had
// already dequeued could land between them and restore a stale reading.
// That makes mu the only synchronization these fields need.
